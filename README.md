# Demostration webapps

These web applications are implemented using Java and can be deployed on a webserver like Tomcat (Tested on apache-tomcat-9.0.58).
All these apps are themed to represent a hypothetical insurance company named "Guardio".

Each can be used to connect with and Identity Provider using the OpenID Connect Protocol.
In order to do that the IdP and the application redirect URLs that need to be communicated to the IdP on request should be configured in WEB-INF/classes/distpatch.properties file
